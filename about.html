<p>I like to travel. 
Outside of my home in the USA, I have visited Belgium, China, England (x3), France, Holland, India (x3), Ireland, Israel, Japan, Morocco, and Peru. 
In the US, I've visted, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, New York, Massachussets, New Jersey, Florida, South Dakota, Minnesota, Michegan, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, California, Arizona, Louisiana, Washington, Washington DC, and Maryland. 
I'm a big fan of cities. San Francisco, Chicago, New York, London, Boston, Paris, Tokyo, Kyoto, Dublin, Seattle and Brussels are among my favorite cities. 
In fact, I think those are all the large cities I've visited.</p>

<p>I am a compulsive maker and always like trying new things. This sounds like a good combination, but it's actually difficult to stay focused on a personal project long enough before something new catches my imagination. 
Because of this, I've dabbled with a ton of really fun technologies and libraries.
 <Strike>HTML, Javascript, CSS, Tornado, PHP, Python, CherryPy, Objective-C, Cocoa, Cocoa Touch, Apache, NginX, Xcode, IntelliJ, Eclipse, Textmate, Emacs, Vi, bash, zsh, MongoDB, My SQL, Spring, Spring MVC, Pico Container,  </strike>.... that list is getting boring. </p>
