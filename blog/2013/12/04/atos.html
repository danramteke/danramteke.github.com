<p><strong>Update!</strong> The information in this blog post is mostly irrelevent now that you can type <code>rake crashlog:device</code> to symbolicate crash logs from your device as of RubyMotion 2.18. <strong>Thanks!</strong></p>
<p>Symbolicating a crash log is the process of finding a line number in source from a crash log. Crash logs often look like <a href="http://i.imgur.com/HLXbG1I.png">this</a>. This specific process is interesting in particular to RubyMotion because Apple's Xcode doesn't symbolicate to Ruby code.</p>
<p>Now let's see how it's done.</p>
<p>After running <code>rake device</code>, you have binary files in the build directory, including a <code>.dSYM</code> file. Go ahead and <code>cd</code> into that directory, I'll be typing all commands from that directory. Here is the directory listing for my <code>build/iPhoneOS-7.0-Development</code> directory: <img src="http://i.imgur.com/Nas5e5N.png" alt="Imgur" /></p>
<p>A good example to use is this crash log I received from our customer: <a href="%7B%7Bsite.baseurl%7D%7Dimages/symbolicating-crashlog.png">Crash Trace</a> <a href="%7B%7Bsite.baseurl%7D%7Dimages/symbolicating-binaryimages.png">Binary Images</a> Another good resource is this handy guide to getting crash logs from Apple devices: <a href="http://help.getpocket.com/customer/portal/articles/500338-how-to-find-the-iphone-ipad-app-crash-logs">Pocket</a></p>
<p>Next, we're going to use a command called <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/atos.1.html">atos</a>. You'll need the load address, the architecture, and the list of addresses from the crash log. I'll show where to get these from the crash log.</p>
<p>Here is the command I typed based on the crash log example: <code>xcrun atos -l 0xed000 -arch armv7 0x00a22a30 0x00a22b56 0x0098caec 0x00a20866 0x00a0a930 0x00a09a66 0x00a0a420 0x0080b524 0x0081241e 0x008124ae -o Redacted\ \(Dev\).dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/Redacted\ \(Dev\)</code></p>
<p>The value for the <code>-l</code> flag is taken from the Binary Images section. That first number there. The value for the <code>-arch</code> flag is <code>arm7</code> since the binaries were built for an iOS device.</p>
<p>The rest of the hex numbers are taken from the first screen shot of the crash log. I copy/pasted them from the crash log for now (would like to hear of a better way). And I got this output:</p>
<pre><code>got symbolicator for Redacted (Dev).dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/Redacted (Dev), base address 4000
__vm_raise() (in Redacted (Dev)) + 276
rb_vm_raise (in Redacted (Dev)) + 82
rb_frozen_class_p (in Redacted (Dev)) + 72
rb_vm_method_missing (in Redacted (Dev)) + 358
rb_vm_dispatch (in Redacted (Dev)) + 3060
rb_vm_trigger_method_missing (in Redacted (Dev)) + 522
rb_vm_dispatch (in Redacted (Dev)) + 1764
vm_fast_plus (in Redacted (Dev)) + 356
__unnamed_28 (in Redacted (Dev)) + 274
rb_scope__commandDidStart:__ (in Redacted (Dev)) (login_view_controller.rb:56)
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the crash was in the login controller. Looking at that file, it's the Facebook log in code.</p>
<p>Although having to copy/paste addresses into the command line isn't ideal, the main goal is retrieving a line number in ruby code (although off by one) from an otherwise opaque crash log intended for Xcode. And this allows further debugging.</p>
