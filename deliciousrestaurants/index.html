Kabuli Palow with Lamb Tikka Kebab. Everything here is really good. Especially these two dishes. Afghani place run by a friendly guy.</p></p>

    <h2>Five Napkin Burger</h2>
    
    <p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.760273,-73.99123&z=16">W 45th and 9th</a></p>
    <p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.760273,-73.99123&z=16"><img class="gmapThumbnail" align="left" src="http://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=40.760273,-73.99123&zoom=15&markers=40.760273,-73.99123&size=165x135&sensor=true" /></a><p>JD and I go here often. The restaurant is always crowded, but the wait is shorter than they hostess promises it will be. There's a bar in the back to order a drink while waiting for an open table. You know when your table is ready when the mini buzzer they give you lights up.</p>

<p>The beer selection is pretty good. Southern Tier comes bottled, Alagash on tap. Other good brews, too. There's a special Five Napkin house brew, but we've never tried it. There's a featured mainstream whiskey, and a couple other whiskeys.</p>

<p>After sitting, the burgers are the main attraction. The namesake burger is delicious. "The garlic aioli really makes it pop."</p>

<p>The burger for two is really nice for two. It's one huge burger that cuts in half. You and your partner each take a half. The meat is cooked and seasoned nicely. Very juicy. The Five Napkin thousand island dressing really brings the burger together. This burger for two is the burger to get. And it comes with two sides.</p>

<p>Their green veggies are a creamed spinach and a garlicky broccoli. They took the creamed spinach off then menu. Now there is only garlicky broccoli. I miss the creamed spinach. So creamy and spinachy. Balanced. Neither too creamy nor too spinachy, as could be the case but isn't. Anyway, it's not on the menu anymore.</p>

<p>The onion rings are pretty good. They're served in a stack, rung around a horseshoe pole. It's our replacement for the creamed spinach.</p>

<p>JD and I also get the butter lettuce-wrapped Inside Out burger when we're feeling extra carb conscious. The butter lettuce tastes crisp and buttery. The lettuce wrap isn't meant to be picked up and eaten like a normal burger. Fork and knife required. The same seasoned patty as the other burgers. The same house thousand island dressing really brings the burger together. The lettuce doesn't soak up the juiciness of the burger the same satisfying way that the seeded bun does.</p>

<p>For starters, they have a spicy sushi roll of sorts with jalape&ntilde;os called "Southwestern." It's crunchy and crispy. And a nice starter for burgers.  Don't miss the pork taquitos. Six little crispy hard shell corn tacos filled with pork and cheese.</p>

French with cumin. They season the lamb appetizer so well and serve it at a medium temperature. They also have an entree portion of their lamb which is served over a huge salad with cumin. Very nice for the carb conscious. Nice wines.</p></p>

    <p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.734799,-74.003236&z=16">W 4th and Charles</a></p>

The sun shines through the windows (there are a lot of them) during lunch time. Start with raw oysters and a glass of white wine. Pick any entree. The best flavor composition of entrees in the city. So many flavors, so many colors, so many ingredients in each entree. And great balance between the flavors. You should spend $100 here.</p>

 <p>There's been a long line (an hour or more) the past few times I've attempted to eat here. Arrive early for dinner. Also, one gotcha is that they are closed on Sundays, which can disappoint after a nice Sunday afternoon walk.</p>

Plantains.</p>

<p>Their hot sauce so good.</p>

<p>Mains: Feijoada (bring a dinner buddy for this, it's a very large portion). Ropa vieja, Carioca's Beef Stew.</p>

<p>And if it wasn't obvious from the name of the restaurant, the rice and beans that comes with every meal. Mix them in liberally with your entree and the delicious hot sauce.</p></p>

They can be a little spicy, even at 'medium' spiciness.

<p>Their 'Country style curry' has no coconut milk. The broth is so flavorful. It's the main reason to get this dish. Filled with vegetables and pork.</p>
