<BlueSection title="Hire me for your complete app"  style={style}>
<div slot="left">
<H2>Build your complete app</H2>
<P>I can build your project from concept to launch. I can build it natively for iOS, web, and Android, along with the right server tooling. I can help you think through your idea and the best way to validate it. I can help you optimize for you time and money. If a server or web component is needed, I can build those, too. </P>

<div slot="middle">
<H2>Augment your team</H2>
<P>
I'm an expert with Agile processes, code reviews, prioritizing, and pair programming.
 I love working with visual designers to make the best look and feel for the app.
 While of course I have my own opinions, I set those aside to match your team's preferences.

Have a project that never published? Need a small change to an open-source library? Need an edit to your website? Need
an architecture change for your app? Have an unreliable build script? Let's talk about how I can help.
