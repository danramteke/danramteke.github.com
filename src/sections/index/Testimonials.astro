                        fashion. He was involved in a number of projects, including a complete re-write of our iOS
                        mobile app using the VIPER pattern. More recently, Dan has worked as an iOS engineer on our
                        Growth team. He works closely with the Stash
                        Marketing department and his experience as a senior engineer has allowed the team to move
