<Layout title="Custom web development">

A website and a webserver often play an important role in a complete app. I've got you covered here. VueJS is my preferred frontend framework, and I'm flexible if your team is already using React, Alpine, or Svelte.


 <BlueSection title="Web toolbox" style="regular">
        <div slot="left">
            <h4>Tailwind CSS</h4>
            <p>

           Tailwind is a fresh take on CSS tooling. It's utilty-first and modular out-of-the box. It's also customizable for managing themes across web properties. This website and <a href="https://www.underway.nyc">www.underway.nyc</a> both use Tailwind CSS.

        <div slot="middle">
            <h4>Astro</h4>

            <p>
                Astro is a relatively new static site generator. It pre-renders static React and Vue components for a fast web experience. It uses JSX style components to manage layouts and re-usable components.
                
                This website and <a href="https://www.underway.nyc">www.underway.nyc</a> are both built using Astro.

        <div slot="right">
            <h4>Vapor</h4>

            <p>
             Vapor is a webapp framework written on Swift, and built on top on non-blocking IO for lightning speed.
             <a href="https://www.underway.nyc">Underway</a>'s server relies on Vapor, not only as a webserver, but also for background workers to fetch & transform data from the MTA.
