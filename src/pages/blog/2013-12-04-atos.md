**Update!** The information in this blog post is mostly irrelevent now that you can type `rake crashlog:device` to symbolicate crash logs from your device as of RubyMotion 2.18. **Thanks!**

Symbolicating a crash log is the process of finding a line number in source from a crash log. Crash logs often look like [this](http://i.imgur.com/HLXbG1I.png). This specific process is interesting in particular to RubyMotion because Apple's Xcode doesn't symbolicate to Ruby code.

Now let's see how it's done.

After running `rake device`, you have binary files in the build directory, including a `.dSYM` file. Go ahead and `cd` into that directory, I'll be typing all commands from that directory. Here is the directory listing for my `build/iPhoneOS-7.0-Development` directory: ![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Nas5e5N.png)

A good example to use is this crash log I received from our customer: [Crash Trace]({{site.baseurl}}images/symbolicating-crashlog.png) [Binary Images]({{site.baseurl}}images/symbolicating-binaryimages.png) Another good resource is this handy guide to getting crash logs from Apple devices: [Pocket](http://help.getpocket.com/customer/portal/articles/500338-how-to-find-the-iphone-ipad-app-crash-logs)

Next, we're going to use a command called [atos](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/atos.1.html). You'll need the load address, the architecture, and the list of addresses from the crash log. I'll show where to get these from the crash log.

Here is the command I typed based on the crash log example: `xcrun atos -l 0xed000 -arch armv7 0x00a22a30 0x00a22b56 0x0098caec 0x00a20866 0x00a0a930 0x00a09a66 0x00a0a420 0x0080b524 0x0081241e 0x008124ae -o Redacted\ \(Dev\).dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/Redacted\ \(Dev\)`

The value for the `-l` flag is taken from the Binary Images section. That first number there. The value for the `-arch` flag is `arm7` since the binaries were built for an iOS device.

The rest of the hex numbers are taken from the first screen shot of the crash log. I copy/pasted them from the crash log for now (would like to hear of a better way). And I got this output:

    got symbolicator for Redacted (Dev).dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/Redacted (Dev), base address 4000
    __vm_raise() (in Redacted (Dev)) + 276
    rb_vm_raise (in Redacted (Dev)) + 82
    rb_frozen_class_p (in Redacted (Dev)) + 72
    rb_vm_method_missing (in Redacted (Dev)) + 358
    rb_vm_dispatch (in Redacted (Dev)) + 3060
    rb_vm_trigger_method_missing (in Redacted (Dev)) + 522
    rb_vm_dispatch (in Redacted (Dev)) + 1764
    vm_fast_plus (in Redacted (Dev)) + 356
    __unnamed_28 (in Redacted (Dev)) + 274
    rb_scope__commandDidStart:__ (in Redacted (Dev)) (login_view_controller.rb:56)

As you can see, the crash was in the login controller. Looking at that file, it's the Facebook log in code.

Although having to copy/paste addresses into the command line isn't ideal, the main goal is retrieving a line number in ruby code (although off by one) from an otherwise opaque crash log intended for Xcode. And this allows further debugging.
