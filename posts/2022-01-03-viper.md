# Intro to Viper

The main goal of VIPER is to break up the "Massive View Controller" (MVC). Other UI architectures have a similar end goal.

In Model View Controller (MVC), the `UIViewController` subclass is often responsible for many things. It assembles the view hierarchy. It makes network calls. It initiates CoreData requests. It transforms results and errors from CoreData into something that a `UILabel` can display, such as a `NSAttributedString`. It's too much!

VIPER breaks up the "Massive View Controller" into one object per role, applying the Single Responsiblilty Principle (SRP). Each object is typically stored in it's own file.

The basic objects of VIPER are View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Router. However, I recommend separating out the responsibilities further.

- the ViewController: `UIViewController`
- the Wireframe: instantiates all these objects, and wires them together

I recommend instead the ViewController, Wireframe, Router, Interactor, Presenter, Entity and ViewModel.
