Daniel was great to work with on the Android pod of the client's mobile team. He is always gentle and empathetic with clients, regardless of situations that could have been understandably aggravating. Any meeting he facilitated was both fun & smoothly run.</p><p class="pb-2 prose">
He had a "jump in & learn" attitude to Android development, without complaining that he wasn't on the iOS team (where he has considerable experience). He picked up the tech stack easily and was able to help guide technical decision-making discussions with clients, even though they had more experience in Android. I could count on areas of the codebase where Daniel had contributed would be in a better state after he'd been there.</p><p class="pb-2 prose">
He also dug into a cross-team task (a CLI tool) that ended up being a can of worms. Despite very real roadblocks, he got it across the line before we rolled off.</p><p class="pb-2 prose">
I hope to work with Daniel on another engagement soon!

Daniel exhibits the standards of excellence in his interpersonal communication style, his day-to-day work, and his contributions to the wider programming community. The trifecta.

<div><a class="underline text-blue-900 hover:text-blue-600" href="https://underway.nyc">Project: Underway</a></div><p class="pb-2 prose">Underway is marvelous. It is the navigation app that I use most consistently on the train, and for good reason. It has exactly the information I need and nothing more, and it executes it perfectly. I know how to read a map. I don’t need colorful directions and an inventive new route that combines ferries, buses, and a dollar van. I want to know when I need to leave my apartment and if it’s worth it to wait for an express train. Underway gets me the information I want and it does it without drama. It also has lots of very thoughtful touches. It works very well offline, and I like that I can send a train tracking link to people I’m meeting so that they can track me live. It’s like flight tracking but for the subway. For all its utility and minimalism, Underway also betrays the meticulousness of its creators. Changes to the subway map are added right away — the walking connection between Times Square and Bryant Park seemed to appear within hours after it opened. Everything works how I need it to, when I need it to. The only thing that might need some more nuanced adjustment is the service change interface, which shows absolutely everything affecting a train at once and can be a touch overwhelming. Other apps do service changes, though. Nothing does what Underway does as well as Underway does it. I haven’t even written an app review in years. I just feel I have a duty to point out the rare thing in our world that is not a disgusting disappointment. This is among them. Bravo!</p></span></li></ul></div></div></div><footer class=" mt-8 pt-2 border-solid bg-sky-900  border-t px-8 text-slate-300 "><p class="py-8"><a href="/" class="hover:underline">&copy;2024 Daniel Ramteke</a></p></footer></body></html>
